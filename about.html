  <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Anna McIntyre. I just graduated from Winchester High School and I am an incoming freshman at the George Washtington University. 
      I was accepted in the Elliot School of International Affairs and I am interested in majoring in Asian Studies. <br>
      
      I was an avid swimmer my whole life and I was on the Varsity Winchester Swim and Dive team for all four years of High School. 
      I also discovered a new passion for Nordic (Skate) Skiing and was on the Winchester Nordic Ski team for three years. In my downtime <br>
      I like to find a good book to read, I recently read Pachinko and The Rice Mother, both books about strong women who must face many challenges.
      My favorite time of the year is when my family rents a beach house in August and we all get to spend time together. I have two older brothers <br>
      already graduated from college and a younger sister still in high school. I also have two adorable boston terrier puppies. </p>
