  <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Anna McIntyre. I just graduated from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.winchesterps.org/schools/winchester_high_school/index.php"> Winchester High School</a> and I am an incoming freshman at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gwu.edu/"> George Washtington University</a>. 
      I was accepted in the Elliot School of International Affairs and I am interested in majoring in Asian Studies. <br> I also currently work at my town's local bookstore, <a target="_blank" href="https://bookendswinchester.indielite.org/">Bookends</a>, and have learned so much from the wonderful people I work with there.
      
      I was an avid swimmer my whole life and I was on the Varsity Winchester Swim and Dive team for all four years of High School. 
      I also discovered a new passion for Nordic (Skate) Skiing and was on the Winchester Nordic Ski team for three years. In my downtime
      I like to find a good book to read, I recently read <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko">Pachinko</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/288119/the-rice-mother-by-rani-manicka/9780142004548/readers-guide/">The Rice Mother</a>, both books about strong women who must face many challenges.
      I also love to travel and the past three years I had the amazing opportunity to go to Guatemala and Panama through the organization <a target="_blank" href="https://schooltheworld.org/">School the World</a> and improve the education of children in rural areas. 
      My favorite time of the year is when my family rents a beach house in August and we all get to spend time together. 
      I have two older brothers who are already graduated from college and a younger sister still in high school. I also have two adorable boston terrier puppies. </p>
